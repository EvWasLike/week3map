		<h1>The FY14 & FY15 ECERS scores of New York City pre-kindergarten programs</h1>

		<p>As of December 2015, there were 1,218 pre-kindergarten programs in New York City. Many of these programs were opened as a part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's initiative to offer universal prekindergarten programs for all four year-olds. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/sunday/how-new-york-made-pre-k-a-success.html?_r=0">According to Deputy Mayor Richard Buery</a>, who oversaw the project, two thousand teachers were recruited, three thousand classrooms opened, and 300 community providers were vetted as prekindergarten partners.</p>

		<p>Now that the program is in full swing, we can begin to measure their performance. The ECERS-R, or Early Childhood Environmental Ratings Scale - Revised edition, is used to measure the success of early childhood settings. It focuses on the settings' use of physical learning, environment, overall health and safety, positive classroom culture, and engagment in meaningful activity. New York City conducted ECERS-R assessments on all Pre-K for All programs offering Pre-K for the first time, or any programs who haven't had an assessment since the 2012-2013 school year.</p>

		<p>The ECERS-R scores of these prekindergarten programs is shown in the map below.</p>
